January 5th 2017 Update:

-Fixed support for KissCartoon and KissAsian

**Installation**

* Install Python 3 [Download Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the latest one.

* Download and copy [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) to location of script

* Install [Chrome](https://www.google.com.au/chrome/browser/desktop/#eula)

* Run UpdateModuals.py (may need to be run with admin/root privileges)

Installation is now done, to use the script run KissDownloaderGUI.py


-python modules use are; Beautifulsoup, cfscrape, pySmartDL, pip

note: these modules should auto install if you have pip installed which is installed by default on python 3.4 and up on windows



The script should work all all platforms however i am only able to test on windows.




For Mac users change the config file destination to look like 
```
destination = /Users/HomeUser/Desktop/
```

Note: This works best with your default player set to flash, and auto play turned off
