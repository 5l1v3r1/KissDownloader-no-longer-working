4th November Update
-now uses a hidden browser
-increased speed of getting urls for videos


**Installation**

* Install Python [Download Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the latest one.

* Run UpdateModuals.py (may need to be run with admin/root privileges)

Installation is now done, to use the script run KissDownloaderGUI.py


-python modules use are; Beautifulsoup, cfscrape, pySmartDL, pip
note: these modules should auto install if you have pip installed which is installed by default on python 3.4 and up on windows


The script should work all all platforms however i am only able to test on windows.

Note: I don't have a Mac computer so I am unable to test further versions of the script
Note: This works best with your default player set to flash, and auto play turned off

For Mac users change the config file destination to look like 
```
destination = /Users/HomeUser/Desktop/
```
