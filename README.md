-python modules use are; Beautifulsoup, cfscrape, pySmartDL, pip

note: these modules should auto install if you have pip installed which is installed by default on python 3.4 and up on windows



The script should work all all platforms however i am only able to test on windows.




For Mac users change the config file destination to look like 
```
destination = /Users/HomeUser/Desktop/
```

Note: This works best with your default player set to flash, and auto play turned off
